To simulate the use of osTicket and working tickets to completion; I created agents (ticket workers) and end users (ticket producers) from within the (Admin) panel on osTicket. Each agent has their own credentials and permissions for what they are able to access and how they are able to interact with each individual ticket. As an end user I created a ticket for one of my agents and observed it and what changes I am able to make as John (Support Agent)

<p>
After recieving ticket from an end user I assigned it to (Agent Jane) with a previously created SLA category to list the problem as urgent. I logged into Jane's osticket and From this point; communication between agent and previous changes can be observed.

After observing communication between agents, department and admin as well as changes; the ticket is marked as completed and marked as resolved.
